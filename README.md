# Data Structures
As the name indicates itself, a Data Structure is a way of organizing the data in the memory so that it can be used efficiently.

* Dynamic Array: A dynamic array is an array that can grow or shrink in size. It starts with a fixed size and, when it reaches capacity, it allocates a larger array, copies the elements over, and deallocates the old array.

* Linked List: A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Variants include singly linked lists (one direction) and doubly linked lists (both directions).

* Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

* Queue: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

* Tree: A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with each node having zero or more children. The top node is called the root.

* Hash Table: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.

* Heap: A heap is a specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property (e.g., in a max-heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children). 

* Graph: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
